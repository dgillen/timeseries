# Weekly Schedule

Each subdirectory of the 16 weeks has the following set of files/director

* **Lessons**: These notebooks are prefixed with `les1`, `les2`, etc. This material is meant to supplemental the textbook
* **Homework**: These notebooks are prexied with `hw1`, `hw2`, etc.  These are the weekly assignment problems.
* **Solutions**: These notebooks are prefixed with `sol1`, `sol2`, etc.  These are the solutions to the assignments.
* **Supplemental**: This directory contains additional material external to this course that support this week's topic
