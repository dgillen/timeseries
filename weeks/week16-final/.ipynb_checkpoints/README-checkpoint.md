# Week 16

For a final project, consider asking students to record or give an in-person whiteboard session of how they'd plan to develop, visualize, data-cleanse for, and evaluate a forecast model of some kind for a business or research intiative. They should provide what kind of data would be used, what is being forecasted and how far out, what analytical value would result, and what tools they plan to use.

Alternatively, this whiteboard session could focus on how to translate the technical forecasting work they completed earlier in the semester to a legible and easily understandable set of analytical conclusions that can be provided to a non-technical audience seeking guidance on their decisions.
