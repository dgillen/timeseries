This week focuses on various ways to classify time series and focuses on 3 key python packages

1. **[sktime]()**
2. **[tslearn](https://github.com/rtavenar/tslearn)**:provides machine learning tools for the analysis of time series. 
3. **[pts](https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts)**: aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing preprocessing and utility tools, and implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms. Most of these algorithms transform time series, thus pyts provides several tools to perform these transformations.

## Lesson Plan

Step through the following notebooks:
1. [Pandas Visualization](les1-pandas-viz.ipynb): Step through this notebook 
2. [Customizing TS Visualization](les2-customizing.ipynb): Step through this notebook to better understand how to customize matplotlib plots

## Homework

1. [Time Series Visualization](hw1-ts-viz.ipynb): Problems asking to create many different types of ts visualizations

## Solution

1. [Time Series Visualization](sol1-ts-viz.ipynb): Solution set
