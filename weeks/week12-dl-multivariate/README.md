# Week 12 `Multivariate Deep Learning`

This week we'll focus on using multivariate deep learning techniques to do time series forecasting.

In this week, you will look at single-step and horizon-style time-series forecasting data preparation and solve some multivariate time-series problems. A multivariate time series is a method where more than one variable is time dependent, and we use these variables to try to estimate a target variable.

## Lesson Plan

Read Vishwas Chapter 7: **Bleeding-Edge Techniques for Multivariate Time Series** and step through [LSTM Notebook](les1-lstm.ipynb)

## Homework

[LSTM Multivarate Energy Forecasting](hw1-lstm.ipynb): Using our newly founded knowledge this week, let's apply Multivariate LSTM model to a new dataset from an energy competition  

## Solution

[Multivariate LSTM](sol1-lstm.ipynb): Solution set

## Course Objectives Addressed

By learning to apply various multivariate LSTM and other deep learning models, we've address the **7th Course Objective**: Build deep learning neural networks to forecast future values for time series
