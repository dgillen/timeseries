# Week 3
This week focuses on various ways to visualize time series.

## Lesson Plan

Step through the following notebooks:
1. [Data Wrangling](les1-wrangling.ipynb): Step through this notebook as a review of the chapter

## Homework

1. [Resampling](hw1-resampling.ipynb): Apply varioius resampling techniques you've learned to a new dataset
2. [Windowing](hw2-rolling.ipynb): Apply varioius windowing and rolling functions you've learned to a new dataset

## Solution

1. [Resampling](sol1-resampling.ipynb): Apply varioius resampling techniques you've learned to a new dataset
2. [Windowing](sol2-rolling.ipynb): Apply varioius windowing and rolling functions you've learned to a new dataset
