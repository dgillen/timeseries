Building forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it’s revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. Building machine learning models is time-consuming and complex with many factors to consider, such as iterating through algorithms, tuning your hyperparameters and feature engineering. These choices multiply with time series data, with additional considerations of trends, seasonality, holidays and effectively splitting training data.

AutoML can reduce the time it takes to build these forecasting models and is an important weapon for a time series analysts to have in their toolbox.
