# Time Series Analysis Course
![img](ts_banner.png "Time Series Analysis")

## Course Description

This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to most time series analysis needed as a data science practitioner.  It is designed to be less theoretical, but instead highly practical as most if not all of the techniques learned are highly applicable in real world situations.  For example, the python preparation and visualization techniques learned in this course can be applied by the student to messy time series he/she is likely to encounter in industry.  Additionally, the automated forecasting and cloud deployment material prepares the student to quickly train & deploy baseline models in a commercial production environment.  The deep learning and classification subjects provide some State Of The Art (SOTA) techniques that are used by both top researchers & competitive startups.  Juptyer notebooks form the core learning tool throughout the course and are used as both instructional and assignment vehicles.
